    The geodatacube API specification for interoperable cloud-based processing of large Earth observation datacubes.

    **Conformance class**: `https://api.geodatacube.example/1.0.0-beta`

    # API Principles

    ## Language

    In the specification the key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119.html) and [RFC 8174](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8174.html).

    ## Casing

    Unless otherwise stated the API works **case sensitive**.

    All names SHOULD be written in snake case, i.e. words are separated with one underscore character (`_`) and no spaces, with all letters lower-cased. Example: `hello_world`. This applies particularly to endpoints and JSON property names. HTTP header fields are generally case-insensitive according to [RFC 7230](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7230.html#section-3.2) and in the specification we follow their respective casing conventions, e.g. `Content-Type` or `GDC-Identifier`, for better readability and consistency.

    ## HTTP / REST

    This uses [HTTP REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) [Level 2](https://martinfowler.com/articles/richardsonMaturityModel.html#level2) for communication between client and back-end server.

    Public APIs MUST be available via HTTPS only. 
    
    Endpoints are made use meaningful HTTP verbs (e.g. GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE) whenever technically possible. If there is a need to transfer big chunks of data for a GET requests to the back-end, POST requests MAY be used as a replacement as they support to send data via request body. Unless otherwise stated, PATCH requests are only defined to work on direct (first-level) children of the full JSON object. Therefore, changing a property on a deeper level of the full JSON object always requires to send the whole JSON object defined by the first-level property.

    Naming of endpoints follow the REST principles. Therefore, endpoints are centered around resources. Resource identifiers MUST be named with a noun in plural form except for single actions that can not be modelled with the regular HTTP verbs. Single actions MUST be single endpoints with a single HTTP verb (POST is RECOMMENDED) and no other endpoints beneath it.

    The API makes use of [HTTP Content Negotiation](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#name-content-negotiation),
    including, but not limited to, the request headers `Accept`, `Accept-Charset` and `Accept-Language`.

    ### JSON

    The API uses JSON for request and response bodies whenever feasible. Services use JSON as the default encoding. Other encodings can be requested using HTTP Content Negotiation ([`Accept` header](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#name-accept)). Clients and servers MUST NOT rely on the order in which properties appear in JSON. To keep the response size small, lists of resources (e.g. the list of batch jobs) usually should not include nested JSON objects, if this information can be requested from the individual resource endpoints (e.g. the metadata for a single batch job).

    ### Charset

    Services use [UTF-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8) as the default charset if not negotiated otherwise with HTTP Content Negotiation ([`Accept-Charset` header](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#name-accept-charset)).

    ## Web Linking
    
    The API is designed in a way that to most entities (e.g. collections and processes) a set of links can be added. These can be alternate representations, e.g. data discovery via OGC WCS or OGC CSW, references to a license, references to actual raw data for downloading, detailed information about pre-processing and more. Clients should allow users to follow the links.

    Whenever links are utilized in the API, the description explains which relation (`rel` property) types are commonly used.
    A [list of standardized link relations types is provided by IANA](https://www.iana.org/assignments/link-relations/link-relations.xhtml) and the API tries to align whenever feasible.

    Some very common relation types - usually not mentioned explicitly in the description of `links` fields - are:
    
    1. `self`: which allows link to the location that the resource can be (permanently) found online.This is particularly useful when the data is data is made available offline, so that the downstream user knows where the data has come from.

    2. `alternate`: An alternative representation of the resource, may it be another metadata standard the data is available in or simply a human-readable version in HTML or PDF.

    3. `about`: A resource that is related or further explains the resource, e.g. a user guide.

    4. `canonical`: This relation type usually points to a publicly accessible and more long-lived URL for a resource that otherwise often requires (Bearer) authentication with a short-lived token.
    This way the the exposed resources can be used by clients without additional authentication steps.
    For example, a shared user-defined process or batch job results could be exposed via a canonical link.
    If a URL should be publicly available to everyone, it can simply a user-specific URL, e.g. `https://geodatacube.example/processes/john_doe/ndvi`.
    For resources that should only be accessible to a certain group of user, a signed URL could be given, e.g. `https://geodatacube.example/processes/81zjh1tc2pt52gbx/ndvi`.

    Generally, it is RECOMMENDED to add descriptive titles (propertty `title`) and media type information (propertty `type`) for a better user experience.

    ## Error Handling

    The success of requests MUST be indicated using [HTTP status codes](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7231.html#section-6) according to [RFC 7231](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7231.html).

    If the API responds with a status code between 100 and 399 the back-end indicates that the request has been handled successfully.

    In general an error is communicated with a status code between 400 and 599. Client errors are defined as a client passing invalid data to the service and the service *correctly* rejecting that data. Examples include invalid credentials, incorrect parameters, unknown versions, or similar. These are generally "4xx" HTTP error codes and are the result of a client passing incorrect or invalid data. Client errors do *not* contribute to overall API availability. 

    Server errors are defined as the server failing to correctly return in response to a valid client request. These are generally "5xx" HTTP error codes. Server errors *do* contribute to the overall API availability. Calls that fail due to rate limiting or quota failures MUST NOT count as server errors. 

    ### JSON error object

    A JSON error object SHOULD be sent with all responses that have a status code between 400 and 599.

    ``` json
    {
      "id": "936DA01F-9ABD-4D9D-80C7-02AF85C822A8",
      "code": "SampleError",
      "message": "A sample error message.",
      "url": "https://geodatacube.example/docs/errors/SampleError"
    }
    ```

    Sending `code` and `message` is REQUIRED. 

    * A back-end MAY add a free-form `id` (unique identifier) to the error response to be able to log and track errors with further non-disclosable details.
    * The `code` is proprietary textual error code.
    * The `message` explains the reason the server is rejecting the request. For "4xx" error codes the message explains how the client needs to modify the request.

      By default the message MUST be sent in English language. Content Negotiation is used to localize the error messages: If an `Accept-Language` header is sent by the client and a translation is available, the message should be translated accordingly and the `Content-Language` header must be present in the response. See "[How to localize your API](http://apiux.com/2013/04/25/how-to-localize-your-api/)" for more information.
    * `url` is an OPTIONAL attribute and contains a link to a resource that is explaining the error and potential solutions in-depth.

    ### Standardized status codes

    The API usually uses the following HTTP status codes for successful requests: 

    - **200 OK**:
      Indicates a successful request **with** a response body being sent.
    - **201 Created**
      Indicates a successful request that successfully created a new resource. Sends a `Location` header to the newly created resource **without** a response body.
    - **202 Accepted**
      Indicates a successful request that successfully queued the creation of a new resource, but it has not been created yet. The response is sent **without** a response body.
    - **204 No Content**:
      Indicates a successful request **without** a response body being sent.

    The API has some commonly used HTTP status codes for failed requests: 

    - **400 Bad Request**:
      The back-end responds with this error code whenever the error has its origin on client side and no other HTTP status code in the 400 range is suitable.

    - **401 Unauthorized**:
      The client did not provide any authentication details for a resource requiring authentication or the provided authentication details are not correct.

    - **403 Forbidden**:
      The client did provided correct authentication details, but the privileges/permissions of the provided credentials do not allow to request the resource.

    - **404 Not Found**:
      The resource specified by the path does not exist, i.e. one of the resources belonging to the specified identifiers are not available at the back-end.
      *Note:* Unsupported endpoints MAY also return HTTP status code 501.

    - **500 Internal Server Error**:
      The error has its origin on server side and no other status code in the 500 range is suitable.

    - **501 Not Implemented**:
      The requested endpoint is part of the API specification, but is not implemented (yet) by the back-end.
      *Note:* Unsupported endpoints MAY also return HTTP status code 404.


    If a HTTP status code in the 400 range is returned, the client SHOULD NOT repeat the request without modifications. For HTTP status code in the 500 range, the client MAY repeat the same request later.

    All HTTP status codes defined in RFC 7231 in the 400 and 500 ranges can be used as error code in addition to the most used status codes mentioned here. Responding with error codes 400 and 500 SHOULD be avoided in favor of any more specific standardized or proprietary error code.

    ## Temporal data

    Date, time, intervals and durations are formatted based on ISO 8601 or its profile [RFC 3339](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3339.html) whenever there is an appropriate encoding available in the standard. All temporal data are specified based on the Gregorian calendar.

    # Authentication

    The API offers one forms of authentication by default:
    * Basic at `GET /credentials/basic`
    * OpenID Connect at `GET /credentials/oidc`
      
    After authentication with any of the methods listed above, the tokens obtained during the authentication workflows can be sent to protected endpoints in subsequent requests.
    
    Further authentication methods MAY be added by back-ends.

    <SecurityDefinitions />

    **Note:** Although it is possible to request several public endpoints for capabilities and discovery that don't require authorization, it is RECOMMENDED that clients (re-)request the public endpoints that support Bearer authentication with the Bearer token once available to also retrieve any private data that is made available specifically for the authenticated user.
    This may require that clients clear any cached data they retrieved from public endpoints before.

    # Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)

    > Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) is a mechanism that allows restricted resources [...] on a web page to be requested from another domain outside the domain from which the first resource was served. [...]
    > CORS defines a way in which a browser and server can interact to determine whether or not it is safe to allow the cross-origin request. It allows for more freedom and functionality than purely same-origin requests, but is more secure than simply allowing all cross-origin requests.
    
    Source: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing)
    
    Geodatacube-API-based back-ends are usually hosted on a different domain / host than the client that is requesting data from the back-end. Therefore most requests to the back-end are blocked by all modern browsers. This leads to the problem that the JavaScript library and any browser-based application can't access back-ends. Therefore, all back-end providers SHOULD support CORS to enable browser-based applications to access back-ends. [CORS is a recommendation of the W3C organization](https://www.w3.org/TR/cors/). The following chapters will explain how back-end providers can implement CORS support.

    **Tip**: Most servers can send the required headers and the responses to the OPTIONS requests automatically for all endpoints. Otherwise you may also use a proxy server to add the headers and OPTIONS responses.
    
    ## CORS headers
    
    The following headers MUST be included with every response:
    
    | Name                             | Description                                                  | Example |
    | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------- |
    | Access-Control-Allow-Origin      | Allowed origin for the request, including protocol, host and port or `*` for all origins. It is RECOMMENDED to return the value `*` to allow requests from browser-based implementations such as the Web Editor. | `*` |
    | Access-Control-Expose-Headers    | Some endpoints require to send additional HTTP response headers such as `GDC-Identifier` and `Location`. To make these headers available to browser-based clients, they MUST be white-listed with this CORS header. The following HTTP headers are white-listed by browsers and MUST NOT be included: `Cache-Control`, `Content-Language`, `Content-Length`, `Content-Type`, `Expires`, `Last-Modified` and `Pragma`. At least the following headers MUST be listed in this version of the API: `Link`, `Location`, and `GDC-Identifier`. | `Link, Location, GDC-Identifier` |
    
    
    
    ### Example request and response
    
    Request:
    
    ```http
    POST /api/v1/jobs HTTP/1.1
    Host: geodatacube.example
    Origin: https://company.example:8080
    Authorization: Bearer basic//ZXhhbXBsZTpleGFtcGxl
    ```
    
    Response:
    
    ```http
    HTTP/1.1 201 Created
    Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
    Access-Control-Expose-Headers: Location, GDC-Identifier, Link
    Content-Type: application/json
    Location: https://geodatacube.example/api/v1/jobs/abc123
    GDC-Identifier: abc123
    ```
    
    ## OPTIONS method
    
    All endpoints must respond to the `OPTIONS` HTTP method. This is a response for the preflight requests made by web browsers before sending the actual request (e.g. `POST /jobs`). It needs to respond with a status code of `204` and no response body.
    **In addition** to the HTTP headers shown in the table above, the following HTTP headers MUST be included with every response to an `OPTIONS` request:
    
    | Name                             | Description                                                  | Example |
    | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------- |
    | Access-Control-Allow-Headers     | Comma-separated list of HTTP headers allowed to be sent with the actual (non-preflight) request. MUST contain at least `Authorization` if any kind of authorization is implemented by the back-end. | `Authorization, Content-Type` |
    | Access-Control-Allow-Methods     | Comma-separated list of HTTP methods allowed to be requested. Back-ends MUST list all implemented HTTP methods for the endpoint. | `OPTIONS, GET, POST, PATCH, PUT, DELETE` |
    | Content-Type                     | SHOULD return the content type delivered by the request that the permission is requested for. | `application/json` |
    
    ### Example request and response
    
    Request:
    
    ```http
    OPTIONS /api/v1/jobs HTTP/1.1
    Host: geodatacube.example
    Origin: https://company.example:8080
    Access-Control-Request-Method: POST 
    Access-Control-Request-Headers: Authorization, Content-Type
    ```
    
    Note that the `Access-Control-Request-*` headers are automatically attached to the requests by the browsers.

    Response:
    
    ```http
    HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
    Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
    Access-Control-Allow-Methods: OPTIONS, GET, POST, PATCH, PUT, DELETE
    Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Authorization, Content-Type
    Access-Control-Expose-Headers: Location, GDC-Identifier, Link
    Content-Type: application/json

    description: |-
      The following endpoints handle user profiles, accounting and authentication. See also [Authentication](#section/Authentication). In general, the API only defines a minimum subset of user management and accounting functionality. It allows to

      * [authenticate and authorize](http://www.differencebetween.net/technology/difference-between-authentication-and-authorization/) a user, which may include [user registration with OpenID Connect](http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-registration-1_0.html),
      * handle storage space limits (disk quota),
      * manage billing, which includes to
          * query the credit a user has available,
          * estimate costs for certain operations (data processing and downloading),
          * get information about produced costs,
          * limit costs of certain operations.

      Therefore, the API leaves some aspects open that have to be handled by the back-ends separately, including 

      * credentials recovery, e.g. retrieving a forgotten password
      * user data management, e.g. changing the users payment details or email address
      * payments, i.e. topping up credits for pre-paid services or paying for post-paid services
      * other accounting related tasks, e.g. creating invoices,
      * user registration (except for [user registration with OpenID Connect](http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-registration-1_0.html)).

      summary: Supported file formats
      operationId: list-file-types
      description: |-
        Lists supported input and output file formats.
        *Input* file formats specify which file a back-end can *read* from.
        *Output* file formats specify which file a back-end can *write* to.

        The response to this request is an object listing all available input
        and output file formats separately with their parameters and additional
        data. This endpoint does not include the supported secondary web
        services.

        **Note**: Format names and parameters MUST be fully aligned with the
        GDAL codes if available, see [GDAL Raster
        Formats](https://gdal.org/drivers/raster/index.html) and [OGR Vector
        Formats](https://gdal.org/drivers/vector/index.html). It is OPTIONAL to
        support all output format parameters supported by GDAL. Some file
        formats not available through GDAL may be defined centrally for the geodatacube.
        Custom file formats or parameters MAY be defined.

        The format descriptions must describe how the file formats relate to 
        data cubes. Input file formats must describe how the files have to be
        structured to be transformed into data cubes. Output file formats must
        describe how the data cubes are stored at the back-end and how the 
        resulting file structure looks like.

        Back-ends MUST NOT support aliases, for example it is not allowed to
        support `geotiff` instead of `gtiff`. Nevertheless, geodatacube clients MAY
        translate user input input for convenience (e.g. translate `geotiff` to
        `gtiff`). Also, for a better user experience the back-end can specify a
        `title`.

        Format names MUST be accepted in a *case insensitive* manner throughout the API.

        Lists available collections with at least the required information.
        
        It is **strongly RECOMMENDED** to keep the response size small by
        omitting larger optional values from the objects in `collections` (e.g. the
        `summaries` and `cube:dimensions` properties).
        To get the full metadata for a collection clients MUST
        request `GET /collections/{collection_id}`.

        This endpoint is compatible with [STAC API 1.0.0 and later](https://stacspec.org) and
        [OGC API - Features 1.0](http://docs.opengeospatial.org/is/17-069r3/17-069r3.html).
        [STAC API extensions](https://stac-api-extensions.github.io) and
        [STAC extensions](https://stac-extensions.github.io)
        can be implemented in addition to what is documented here.

        Note: Although it is possible to request public collections without
        authorization, it is RECOMMENDED that clients (re-)request the collections
        with the Bearer token once available to also retrieve any private collections.

                      the surface spectral reflectance of Terra MODIS Bands
                      1-2 corrected for atmospheric conditions such as gasses,
                      aerosols, and Rayleigh scattering. Provided along with
                      the two 250 m MODIS bands is one additional layer, the
                      Surface Reflectance QC 250 m band. For each pixel, a
                      value is selected from all the acquisitions within the
                      8-day composite period. The criteria for the pixel
                      choice include cloud and solar zenith. When several
                      acquisitions meet the criteria the pixel with the
                      minimum channel 3 (blue) value is used. Validation at
                      stage 3 has been achieved for all MODIS Surface
                      Reflectance products.

      description: |-
        Lists **all** supported metadata filters (also called "queryables") for
        a specific collection.

        This endpoint is compatible with endpoint defined in the STAC API extension
        [`filter`](https://github.com/stac-api-extensions/filter#queryables) and
        [OGC API - Features - Part 3: Filtering](https://github.com/opengeospatial/ogcapi-features/tree/master/extensions/filtering).
        For a precise definition please follow those specifications.

        This endpoints provides a JSON Schema for each queryable that geodatacube
        users can use in multiple scenarios:
        1. For loading data from the collection, e.g. in the process `load_collection`.
        2. For filtering items using CQL2 on the `/collections/{collection_id}/items` endpoint.

        Note: Providing the Bearer token is REQUIRED for private collections.

        Fetch features of the feature collection with id `collection_id`.

        Every feature in a dataset belongs to a collection. A dataset may
        consist of multiple feature collections. A feature collection is often a
        collection of features of a similar type, based on a common schema.
      operationId: list-items
      parameters:
        - $ref: '#/components/parameters/collection_id'
        - $ref: "#/components/parameters/pagination_limit"
        - $ref: "#/components/parameters/bbox"
        - $ref: "#/components/parameters/datetime"
      responses:
        "200":
          description: |-
            The response is a document consisting of features in the collection.
            The features included in the response are determined by the server
            based on the query parameters of the request. To support access to
            larger collections without overloading the client, the API supports
            paged access with links to the next page, if more features are selected
            that the page size.

            The `bbox` and `datetime` parameter can be used to select only a
            subset of the features in the collection (the features that are in the
            bounding box or time interval). The `bbox` parameter matches all features
            in the collection that are not associated with a location, too. The
            `datetime` parameter matches all features in the collection that are
            not associated with a time stamp or interval, too.

            The `limit` parameter may be used to control the subset of the
            selected features that should be returned in the response, the page size.
            Each page may include information about the number of selected and
            returned features (`numberMatched` and `numberReturned`) as well as
            links to support paging (link relation `next`).

        according to RFC 7617](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7617.html) and returns
        an access token for valid credentials.


        The credentials (username and password) MUST be sent in the HTTP header
        `Authorization` with type `Basic` and the Base64 encoded string
        consisting of username and password separated by a double colon `:`. The
        header would look as follows for username `user` and password `pw`:
        `Authorization: Basic dXNlcjpwdw==`.


        The access token has to be used in the Bearer token for authorization in
        subsequent API calls (see also the information about Bearer tokens in
        this document). The access token returned by this request MUST NOT be
        provided with `basic//` prefix, but the Bearer Token sent in subsequent
        API calls to protected endpoints MUST be prefixed with `basic//`. The
        header in subsequent API calls would look as follows: `Authorization:
        Bearer basic//TOKEN` (replace `TOKEN` with the actual access token).


        It is RECOMMENDED to implement this authentication method for non-public
        services only.

        Lists the supported [OpenID Connect](http://openid.net/connect/)
        providers (OP). OpenID Connect Providers MUST support [OpenID Connect
        Discovery](http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html).

        It is highly RECOMMENDED to implement OpenID Connect for public services
        in favor of Basic authentication.

        openEO clients MUST use the **access token** as part of the Bearer token
        for authorization in subsequent API calls (see also the information
        about Bearer tokens in this document). Clients MUST NOT use the id token
        or the authorization code. The access token provided by an OpenID Connect
        Provider does not necessarily provide information about the issuer (i.e. the
        OpenID Connect provider) and therefore a prefix MUST be added to the Bearer
        Token sent in subsequent API calls to protected endpoints. The Bearer
        Token sent to protected endpoints MUST consist of the authentication
        method (here `oidc`), the provider ID and the access token itself. All
        separated by a forward slash `/`. The provider ID corresponds to the
        value specified for `id` for each provider in the response body of this
        endpoint.  The header in subsequent API calls for a provider with `id`
        `ms` would look as follows: `Authorization: Bearer oidc/ms/TOKEN`
        (replace `TOKEN` with the actual access token received from the OpenID
        Connect Provider).

        Back-ends MAY request user information ([including Claims](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#Claims))
        from the [OpenID Connect Userinfo endpoint](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#UserInfo)
        using the access token (without the prefix described above). Therefore,
        both openEO client and openEO back-end are relying parties (clients) to
        the OpenID Connect Provider.

                            include instruction on setting up `client_id`, `client_secret` and `redirect_uri`.

                            List of default OpenID Connect clients that can be used by an openEO client
                            for OpenID Connect based authentication.

                            A default OpenID Connect client is managed by the back-end implementer.
                            It MUST be configured to be usable without a client secret,
                            which limits its applicability to OpenID Connect grant types like
                            "Authorization Code Grant with PKCE" and "Device Authorization Grant with PKCE"

                            A default OpenID Connect client is provided without availability guarantees.
                            The back-end implementer CAN revoke, reset or update it any time.
                            As such, openEO clients SHOULD NOT store or cache default OpenID Connect client information
                            for long term usage.
                            A default OpenID Connect client is intended to simplify authentication for novice users.
                            For production use cases, it is RECOMMENDED to set up a dedicated OpenID Connect client.

        Stores a provided user-defined process with process graph that can be
        reused in other processes.
        
        If a process with the specified `process_graph_id` exists, the process
        is fully replaced. The id can't be changed for existing user-defined
        processes. The id MUST be unique across its namespace.

        Partially updating user-defined processes is not supported.

        To simplify exchanging user-defined processes, the property `id` can be part of
        the request body. If the values don't match, the value for `id` gets
        replaced with the value from the `process_graph_id` parameter in the
        path.

        Lists supported secondary web service protocols such as
        [OGC WMS](http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wms),
        [OGC WCS](http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wcs),
        [OGC API - Features](https://www.ogc.org/standards/ogcapi-features)
        or [XYZ tiles](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Slippy_map_tilenames).
        The response is an object of all available secondary web service protocols
        with their supported configuration settings and expected process parameters.

        * The configuration settings for the service SHOULD be defined upon
          creation of a service and the service will be set up accordingly.
        * The process parameters SHOULD be referenced (with a `from_parameter`
          reference) in the user-defined process that is used to compute web service
          results.
          The appropriate arguments MUST be provided to the user-defined process,
          usually at runtime from the context of the web service,
          For example, a map service such as a WMS would
          need to inject the spatial extent into the user-defined process so that the
          back-end can compute the corresponding tile correctly.

        To improve interoperability between back-ends common names for the
        services SHOULD be used, e.g. the abbreviations used in the official
        [OGC Schema Repository](http://schemas.opengis.net/) for the respective
        services.

        Service names MUST be accepted in a *case insensitive* manner throughout the API.

        The available process parameters are specified per
        service type at `GET /service_types`.

        **Note:** Costs incurred by shared secondary web services are usually
        paid by the owner, but this depends on the service type and whether it
        supports charging fees or not.

      description: |-
        **NOTE:** This endpoint may return a job from openEO or OGC API - Processes. Distinguish them via the `assets` property which is always present for openEO, but not for OGC API - Processes.

        ## OGC API - Processes
        Lists available results of a job. In case of a failure, lists exceptions instead.

        For more information, see [Section 7.13](https://docs.ogc.org/is/18-062/18-062.html#sc_retrieve_job_results).

        ## openEO
        Lists signed URLs pointing to the processed files, usually after the batch job
        has finished. Back-ends may also point to intermediate results after the
        job has stopped due to an error or if the `partial` parameter has been set.
        
        The response includes additional metadata. It is a valid
        [STAC Item](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/tree/v1.0.0/item-spec)
        (if it has spatial and temporal references included) or a valid
        [STAC Collection](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/tree/v1.0.0/collection-spec).
        The assets to download are in both cases available in the property `assets`
        and have the same structure. All additional metadata is not strictly required
        to download the files, but are helpful for users to understand the data.

        STAC Collections can either (1) add all assets as collection-level assets or
        (2) link to STAC Catalogs and STAC Items with signed URLs, which will provide a full
        STAC catalog structure a client has to go through. Option 2 is overall the better 
        architectural choice and allows a fine-grained description of the processed data.

        Clients are RECOMMENDED to store this response and all potential sub-catalogs
        and items with the assets so that the downloaded data is then a self-contained
        STAC catalog user could publish easily with all the data and metadata.

        URL signing is a way to protect files from unauthorized access with a
        key in the URL instead of HTTP header based authorization. The URL
        signing key is similar to a password and its inclusion in the URL allows
        to download files using simple GET requests supported by a wide range of
        programs, e.g. web browsers or download managers. Back-ends are
        responsible to generate the URL signing keys and to manage their
        appropriate expiration. The back-end MAY indicate an expiration time by
        setting the `expires` property in the reponse. Requesting this endpoint
        SHOULD always return non-expired URLs. Signed URLs that were generated
        for a previous request and already expired SHOULD NOT be reused,
        but regenerated with new expiration time.
        Signed URLs that expired MAY return an error.

        It is **strongly recommended** to add a link with relation type `canonical`
        to the STAC Item or STAC Collection (see the `links` property for details).

        If processing has not finished yet and the `partial` parameter is not set to `true`
        requests to this endpoint MUST be rejected an error.

        Adds a batch job to the processing queue to compute the results.

        The result will be stored in the format specified in the process.
        To specify the format use a process such as `save_result`.

        The job status is set to `queued`, if processing doesn't start
        instantly. The same applies if the job status is `canceled`, `finished`,
        or `error`, which restarts the job and discards previous results if the
        back-end doesn't reject the request with an error.
        Clients SHOULD warn users and ask for confirmation if results may get
        discarded.

        * Once the processing starts the status is set to `running`.
        * Once the data is available to download the status is set to
        `finished`.
        * Whenever an error occurs during processing, the status MUST be set to
        `error`.

        This endpoint has no effect if the job status is already `queued` or
        `running`. In particular, it doesn't restart a running job. To restart
        a queued or running job, processing MUST have been canceled before.

        `DELETE /jobs/{job_id}`.

        This endpoint only has an effect if the job status is `queued` or

        The job status is set to `canceled` if the status was `running`

                      2. `alternate`: Any other representation of these (and potentially additional)
                      user information, e.g. the (public) user profile page.
                      It is RECOMMENDED to add descriptive titles for a better user experience.

                      3. `related`: Any other user-specific links to be shown in clients,
                      e.g. to user-specific settings, invoices, etc. It is RECOMMENDED to 
                      add descriptive titles for a better user experience.

            field is set to `proprietary` or `various`.

            3. `example`: Links to examples of processes that use this collection.

            4. `latest-version`: If a collection has been marked as deprecated, a link SHOULD
            point to the latest version of the collection. The relation types `predecessor-version`
            (link to older version) and `successor-version` (link to newer version) can also be used
            to show the relation between versions.

            5. `alternate`: An alternative representation of the collection.
            For example, this could be the collection available through another
            catalog service such as OGC CSW, a human-readable HTML version or a
            metadata document following another standard such as ISO 19115 or DCAT.

            statistical values. The range can specify the
            potential range of values, but it is recommended to be
            as precise as possible. The set of values MUST contain
            at least one element and it is strongly RECOMMENDED to
            list all values. It is recommended to list as many
            properties as reasonable so that consumers get a full

        Each bounding box is provided as four or six numbers,
        depending on whether the coordinate reference system
        includes a vertical axis (height or depth):

        * West (lower left corner, coordinate axis 1)
        * South (lower left corner, coordinate axis 2)
        * Base (optional, minimum value, coordinate axis 3)
        * East (upper right corner, coordinate axis 1)
        * North (upper right corner, coordinate axis 2)
        * Height (optional, maximum value, coordinate axis 3)

        The coordinate reference system of the values is WGS 84
        longitude/latitude (http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/OGC/1.3/CRS84).

        For WGS 84 longitude/latitude the values are in most cases
        the sequence of minimum longitude, minimum latitude, maximum
        longitude and maximum latitude.

        However, in cases where the box spans the antimeridian the
        first value (west-most box edge) is larger than the third value
        (east-most box edge).

        If the vertical axis is included, the third and the sixth
        number are the bottom and the top of the 3-dimensional bounding box.

        The following options are predefined by the geodatacube API, but additional

        * `null` (default): Checks both user-defined and predefined processes,
           but prefers user-defined processes if both are available.
           This allows users to add missing predefined processes for portability,
           e.g. common processes from [processes.openeo.org](https://processes.openeo.org)
           that have a process graph included.
           It is RECOMMENDED to log the namespace selected by the back-end for debugging purposes.
        * `backend`: Uses exclusively the predefined processes listed at `GET /processes`.
        * `user`: Uses exclusively the user-defined processes listed at `GET /process_graphs`.

        If multiple processes with the same identifier exist, Clients SHOULD
        inform the user that it's recommended to select a namespace.

            * `POST /jobs/{job_id}/results`: The status is set to `queued`, if

                * Once the processing starts the status is set to `running`.
                * Once the data is available to download the status is set to `finished`.
                * Whenever an error occurs during processing, the status MUST be set to `error`.
            * `DELETE /jobs/{job_id}/results`: The status is set to `canceled` if
            the status was `running` beforehand and partial or preliminary results
            are available to be downloaded. Otherwise the status is set to

            1. `created`: When the batch job was executed before and has been reset to `created` after an
               [update](#tag/Batch-Jobs/operation/update-job) there could still be results and logs available
               until they get discarded by [queueing the batch job again](#tag/Batch-Jobs/operation/start-job).
            2. `finished`: The full log and results are expected to be available.
            3. `error` / `canceled`: Partial results and logs may be available.

        This parameter enables pagination for the endpoint and specifies the maximum number of
        elements that arrays in the top-level object (e.g. collections, processes, batch jobs,
        secondary services, log entries, etc.) are allowed to contain.
        The `links` array MUST NOT be paginated like the resources,
        but instead contain links related to the paginated resources
        or the pagination itself (e.g. a link to the next page).
        If the parameter is not provided or empty, all elements are returned.

        Pagination is OPTIONAL: back-ends or clients may not support it.
        Therefore it MUST be implemented in a way that clients not supporting
        pagination get all resources regardless. Back-ends not supporting
        pagination MUST return all resources.

        If the response is paginated, the `links` array MUST be used to communicate the
        links for browsing the pagination with predefined `rel` types. See the `links` array schema
        for supported `rel` types.
        Back-end implementations can, unless specified otherwise, use all kind of pagination techniques,
        depending on what is supported best by their infrastructure: page-based, offset-based, token-based
        or something else. The clients SHOULD use whatever is specified
        in the links with the corresponding `rel` types.

        Only features that have a geometry that intersects the bounding box are selected.
        The bounding box is provided as four or six numbers, depending on whether the
        coordinate reference system includes a vertical axis (height or depth):

        * Lower left corner, coordinate axis 1
        * Lower left corner, coordinate axis 2
        * Minimum value, coordinate axis 3 (optional)
        * Upper right corner, coordinate axis 1
        * Upper right corner, coordinate axis 2
        * Maximum value, coordinate axis 3 (optional)

        The coordinate reference system of the values is WGS 84 longitude/latitude
        (http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/OGC/1.3/CRS84).

        For WGS 84 longitude/latitude the values are in most cases the sequence of
        minimum longitude, minimum latitude, maximum longitude and maximum latitude.
        However, in cases where the box spans the antimeridian the first value
        (west-most box edge) is larger than the third value (east-most box edge).

        If the vertical axis is included, the third and the sixth number are
        the bottom and the top of the 3-dimensional bounding box.

        If a feature has multiple spatial geometry properties, it is the decision of the
        server whether only a single spatial geometry property is used to determine
        the extent or all relevant geometries.
